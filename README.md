# SWIPT
Simultaneous Wireless Information &amp; Power Transfer
Far-field microwave power transfer (MPT) will free wireless sensors and other mobile devices from the constraints imposed by finite battery capacities. Integrating MPT with wireless communications to support simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) allows the same spectrum to be used for dual purposes without compromising the quality of service.

A novel approach is presented in this report for realizing SWIPT in a broadband system where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and transmit beam forming are deployed to create a set of parallel sub-channels for SWIPT, which simplifies resource allocation. Based on a proposed reconfigurable mobile architecture, different system configurations are considered by combining single-user/multi-user systems, downlink/uplink information transfer, and variable/fixed coding rates. Optimizing the power control for these configurations results in a new
class of multi-user power-control problems featuring the circuit power
constraints, specifying that the transferred power must be sufficiently large to support the operation of the receiver circuitry.
As this emerging
technology enables proactive energy replenishment of wireless devices, it is advantageous in supporting applications with quality of service (QoS) requirements.
